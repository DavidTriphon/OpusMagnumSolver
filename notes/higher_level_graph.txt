nodes are sets of molecules

resources available per neighbor:
    parts from partlist

    movements are not exclusive resources
    area overlap on parts is exclusive
    this makes part usage exclusive

actions are:
    add reagent:
        1 reagent input part
        1 arm (1 grab)
    bond
        1 bonder
        2 atoms on bonder
        1-2 movements
            1+ arms per movement
    debond
        1 debonder
        1 movement
            1 arm
    calcify
        1 calcification
        1 atom on calcifier
        1 movement
            1 arm
    remove product:
        1 product output part
        1 drop
            1 arm per drop (all grabbed arms must drop)
