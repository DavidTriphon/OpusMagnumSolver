=== cycle strategy ===

two phases:
    A. determine optimal manufacture time and order
    B. search through the spacial and temporal constraints to find a valid
    assembly configuration

exceptions:
    - there is not enough space to make certain transitions within the allotted
    free time.
    - remaining compute time is limited, use another algorithm that does not
    guarantee the best metric but does guarantee that a solution will be found
    quickly.

possible intervening points:
    assert a manufacture schedule and operation order per single product

=== cost strategy ===

1. determine minimum recipe parts required
2. determine number of spaces required accessible by arms
3. determine the lowest cost arm setup for that number of spaces
4. determine a placement that appears to be the least restrictive
5. search through possible molecule operation orders that fit within the space
5. program the arms to create the product using the set operation order

exceptions:
    - too many reagents to handle with one arm
