stage 1A.
- is a bonder necessary?
	all reagents are smaller than the product?
- is a bonder unnecessary?
	all products are 1 atom?
- is a debonder necessary?
	all reagents are larger than the product?
- is a debonder unnecessary?
	all reagents are 1 atom?

stage 1B.
    identify product atom types that must be produced.

    list available glyphs and inputs that create these types for each.
    do any of these atom types only have 1 part that creates them?
        if only 1 part creates them, that part is necessary
        is there only 1 recipe that produces that type using this part?
            if only 1 recipe is compatible, its inputs must be satisfied too,
            without looping back to the previous type.

            if there are multiple compatible recipes, at least one of those
            recipes inputs must all be satisfied for. (the only case for this is
             calcification)

        if there are multiple parts that can satisfy this type, ambiguity should
        be left.

stage 1C.
    if bonder is not constrained or debonder is not constrained
    reconsider bonder and debonders again, using constrained knowledge from step
    2.

    ex. Gold is constrained to a projection recipe, which requires quicksilver
    and Silver.

    quicksilver is a single atom product for operating the projector glyph.
    That means a quicksilver atom must be debonded until it has no bonds so that
    it can be used as an input to the projection. If all quicksilver atoms are
    bonded, then a debonder is necessary. If any QS is not bonded in an input,
    it can be used and a debonder is not necessary.
