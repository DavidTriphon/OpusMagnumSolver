test 391:
    - naive dijkstra, no heuristic:
        nodes/frames explored: 140k
        duration: ~86.7 seconds
    - a_star, inconsistent & unmeasured heuristic:
        nodes/frames explored: 54k (60% reduction from previous)
        duration: ~31.2 seconds (-55 from previous)
    - optimized rotate function in hexmath:
        nodes/frames: unchanged
        duration: ~22 seconds (-10 from previous)
    - optimized heuristic, adding an atom reduced heuristc cost by 4 now
        nodes/frames explored: 38k (-16k)
        duration: ~14.5 seconds (-8 from previous)
    * alternate heuristic found: overfitted, punishes having 3+ waters
        nodes/frames explored: 6k (-32k)
        duration: ~2.5 seconds (-12 from previous)
    - 99% consistent heuristic
        nodes/frames explored: 24k (-14k from 2nd previous)
        duration: ~8.5 seconds (-6 from 2nd previous)
    - added punishment based on known bond angles in product
        nodes/frames explored: 16k (-8k from previous)
        duration: ~6.5 seconds (-2 from previous)
