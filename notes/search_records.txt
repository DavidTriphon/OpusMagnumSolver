test 391:
    - naive djikstra, no heuristic:
        nodes/frames explored: 140k
        duration: ~86.7 seconds
    - a_star, inconsistent & unmeasured heuristic:
        nodes/frames explored: 54k (60% reduction from previous)
        duration: ~31.2 seconds (-55 from previous)
    - optimized rotate function in hexmath:
        nodes/frames: unchanged
        duration: ~22 seconds (-10 from previous)
    - optimized heuristic, adding an atom reduced heuristc cost by 4 now
        nodes/frames explored: 38k (-16k)
        duration: ~14 seconds (-8 from previous)
