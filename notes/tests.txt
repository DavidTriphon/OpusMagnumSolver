notable tests for monitoring

- sample 065:
    salt-fire + salt => fire-salt + fire-fire
    no duplication
    calcification is not needed
    second reagent is useless
    first product matches first reagent

- test 070:
    earth + fire + water + air => QE-Air-Fire
    unification (and dispersion)

- test 128:
    lead-iron ==> silver
    just purification

- test 187:
    earth + fire + salt => salt-salt
    duplication
        cost strategy means only salt reagent is optimal
        basically 1-2 base test with optimizations

- test 276:
    1 air => 3 air + 9 salt
    partial calcification
    no duplication
    12:1 ratio

- test 391
    water => salt-salt-salt-water
    very simple base case for a cost-focused solver

- test 435:
    1 fire => 1 fire + 4 salt
    partial calcification
    no duplication
    5:1 ratio

- test 464:
    6 elements => 1 salt
    all calcification
    no duplication
    1:6 ratio
