notable tests for monitoring

- sample 065:
    salt-fire + salt => fire-salt + fire-fire
    no duplication
    calcification is not needed
    second reagent is useless
    first product matches first reagent

- test 070:
    earth + fire + water + air => QE-Air-Fire
    unification (and dispersion)

- test 128:
    lead-iron ==> silver
    just purification

- test 187:
    earth + fire + salt => salt-salt
    duplication
        cost strategy means only salt reagent is optimal
        basically 1-2 base test with optimizations

- test 276:
    1 air => 3 air + 9 salt
    partial calcification
    no duplication
    12:1 ratio

- test 391:
    water => salt-salt-salt-water
    very simple base case for a cost-focused solver

- test 435:
    1 fire => 1 fire + 4 salt
    partial calcification
    no duplication
    5:1 ratio

- test 464:
    6 elements => 1 salt
    all calcification
    no duplication
    1:6 ratio

TESTS THAT DEFINE BONDING REQUIREMENT BORDERS:
        All tests satisfy the prerequisite that a reagent with the same
        number of atoms exists for every product

- test 010:
    Earth-Copper + QuickSilver => Earth-Silver
    has extra reagent, but one reagent is convertible to the product

- test 023:
    QE-QE + QE => Earth-Water
    requires bonder, but not debonder if QE-QE is unused

- test 046:
    fire-air => salt-salt
    all atoms are convertible to the product

- test 125:
    air + water-earth => Vitae-earth
    equal bonding, but not convertible
    requires debonder and bonder

- test 284:
    Fire-Earth + Earth + Earth => Vitae-Mors
    requires bonder, animismus, calcifier

- test 393:
    fire-fire => fire-vitae
    equal bonds, but requires bonder and debonder,
      because fire is not convertible to vitae.
    (also requires animismus and calcifier)

- test 458:
    Salt-Vitae => Earth-Vitae + Earth-Fire
    first product does not require debonding or bonding
    second product does require bonding/debonding

- test 510:
    Earth-Water + Earth => Vitae-Mors + Vitae-Vitae
    requires calcification, animismus, bonding

- test 534:
    Salt + Salt-Salt => Fire-Earth
    does not require bonding if first reagent is unused
    only requires duplicator and berlo wheel

- test 632:
    QuickSilver + Vitae-Lead + QuickSilver => Vitae-Gold
    Does not require bonding
    requires projection

- test 645:
    Salt + Salt + Salt-Salt => Vitae-Mors
    requires bonding, but not debonding
    requires animismus

- test 702:
    Copper-QuickSilver + Fire => Mors-Silver
    require debonder and bonder
    debonder to detach the quicksilver to convert copper to silver
    bonder to attach mors to silver

- test 799:
    salt + vitae-QE => QE-vitae
    product matches reagent
    no production necessary

- test 803:
    Fire-Vitae => Vitae-Earth + Vitae-Earth
    no bonding required
    calcifier and duplicator and berlo required
    convert fire to salt to earth

- test 832:
    Air + Salt-Silver + Fire => Salt-Fire + Salt-Silver
    Salt-Silver is already satisfied by reagent
    Salt-Fire requires either a calcifier or a debonder
        fire is provided by reagent
        salt is produced by calcifying fire or air,
          or by detaching it from silver
          both options are equal cost
          calcifying is preferable since it does not produce waste in the ratio
        salt-fire inherently requires bonding
